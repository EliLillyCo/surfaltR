\description{
For the gene name and transcript ID input, we have included 5 unique mouse 
transcripts from 5 different genes annotated as alternative by APPRIS. These 
genes were derived from supplementary data 12 from Uhl√©n et all 2015. This 
data has been formatted to be compatible with the package and to match the 
genes in the HPA human gene dataset.
