\description{
For the gene name and transcript ID input, we have included 10 unique human
transcripts from 7 different genes annotated as alternative by APPRIS. These
genes were derived from supplementary data 12 from Uhl√©n et all 2015.
This data has been formatted to be compatible with the package.
