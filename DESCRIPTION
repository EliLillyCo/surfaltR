Description: Cell surface proteins form a major fraction of the druggable proteome
  and can be used for tissue-specific delivery of oligonucleotide/cell-based therapeutics. 
  Alternatively spliced surface protein isoforms have been shown to differ in their subcellular 
  localization and/or their transmembrane (TM) topology. Surface proteins are hydrophobic and 
  remain difficult to study thereby necessitating the use of TM topology prediction 
  methods such as TMHMM and Phobius. However, there exists a need for bioinformatic 
  approaches to streamline batch processing of isoforms for comparing and visualizing 
  topologies. To address this gap, we have developed an R package, SurfaltR. It pairs 
  inputted isoforms, either known alternatively spliced or novel, with their APPRIS 
  annotated principal counterparts, predicts their TM topologies using TMHMM or Phobius, 
  and generates a customizable graphical output. Further, surfaltR facilitates the 
  prioritization of biologically diverse isoform pairs through the incorporation 
  of three different ranking metrics and through protein alignment functions.
