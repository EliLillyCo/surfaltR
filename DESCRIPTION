Description: Cell surface proteins are of great biomedical relevance, serving 
    as cell type differentiators and indicators of disease states. Consequently,
    proteins on the plasma membrane form a major fraction of the druggable 
    proteome and are also used to target novel therapeutic modalities to 
    specific cells. Alternatively spliced surface protein isoforms have been 
    shown to differ based on their localization within cells and their 
    transmembrane (TM) topology. Thus, in depth analysis of cell surface protein
    isoforms can not only expand the diversity of the druggable proteome but 
    also aid in differentiating delivery between closely related cell types. 
    The transcriptomic and proteomic approaches available 
    today make it possible to identify several novel alternatively spliced 
    isoforms. However, there exists a need for bioinformatic approaches to 
    streamline batch processing of isoforms to predict and visualize their TM 
    topologies. To address this gap, we have developed an R package, SurfaltR, 
    which matches inputted novel or alternative isoforms to their annotated 
    principal counterparts, rapidly predicts their TM topologies, and generates 
    a user-friendly graphical output. Further, SurfaltR facilitates the 
    prioritization of biologically diverse isoform pairs through the 
    incorporation of three different ranking metrics in the graphical output and
    through several protein alignment functions.
