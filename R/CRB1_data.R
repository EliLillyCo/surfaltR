#' SurfaltR Amino Acid Test Data- Novel Mouse Retina Isoforms
#'
#' For the amino acid input, we have utilized the supplementary data 1 from Ray
#' et al 2020 (ref). This data includes novel isoforms expressed in mouse
#' retina identified by long read sequencing and further validated by cell
#' surface proteomics approaches. The data has been formatted to be compatible
#' with the package.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 36 rows and 3 variables:
#' \describe{
#' \item{external_gene_name}{Gene name corresponding to amino acid sequence}
#' \item{transcript_id}{transcript ID corresponding to amino acid sequence}
#' \item{protein_sequence}{amino acid sequence of transcript}
