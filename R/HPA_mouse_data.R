#' SurfaltR Gene Name and Transcript ID Test Data- Highly Expressed Mouse Alternative Transcripts
#'
#' For the gene name and transcript ID input, we have included 5 unique mouse 
#' transcripts from 5 different genes annotated as alternative by APPRIS. These 
#' genes were derived from supplementary data 12 from Uhl√©n et all 2015. This 
#' data has been formatted to be compatible with the package and to match the 
#' genes in the HPA human gene dataset.

#' @format A data frame with 5 rows and 2 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{gene_name}{Gene name corresponding to transcript ID}
#'   \item{transcript}{transcript ID of gene of interest}
